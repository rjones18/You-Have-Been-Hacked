# You-Have-Been-Hacked
If run on a windows computer, this script will take control of the mouse and keyboard and force the computer to save an image on the user's computer. After that, the image is set as the user background and a warning message pops up saying "You Have Been Hacked!". This is done by using the `pyautogui` library to control the computer's actions and `ctypes` library for the pop-up box that appears after the screen saver has been changed. Below is the video of how it looks when the script is run:
